# Khan Academy Javascript Projects (archive)

Archive for my Khan Academy projects, written in Javascript (using p5.js) and HTML code. These projects were made from 2016-2019 with the Khan Academy Computer Programming courses. I learned basic Javasript, SQL, HTML and CSS with these courses. I had lot's of fun building platformer games and animations.

I included a working p5.js library file to run the games, but I add screenshot/gifs as well since it is pretty flaky.

# Khan Academy Javascript Projects
Archive for my Khan Academy projects, written in Javascript (using p5.js) and HTML code.

I decided to save all of the code in a single repository with a WORKING p5.js library that matches custom Khan Academy functions. In case Khan Academy shut's down or my account is deleted, I can run and view all of the code that the live-editor could.

These projects were made from 2016-2019 with the Khan Academy Computer Programming courses. I learned basic Javasript, SQL, HTML and CSS with these courses. I had lot's of fun building platformer games and animations.
## Setup
